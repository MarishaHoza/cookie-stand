            <h3>Our Cookies</h3>
            <p> 
              Our founder, Pat, has come up with a wonderful cookie idea by combining two signature Seattle icons: coffie-time confections and salmon!
              <br/>
              <br/>
              They're cookies made into the shape of a salmon, and actually made with salmon (though the fish is ground up so fine that you can't even taste it!) that is the ideal match for a steaming cup of coffee on a gray Seattle morning. 
              <br/>
              <br/>
              Our cookies are salmon-shaped, too! See an example of a finished cookie by interacting with the cookie cutter image.
