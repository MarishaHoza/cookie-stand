## Pat's Salmon Cookie Stands
The purpose of this site is for Pat to market and keep track of his salmon cookie stands.

### Main page
The main page is primarily for marketing and updating customers about the shops.

### Sales page
The sales page is for Pat's use. This page estimates the total number of cookies needed per hour and day for each of Pat's salmon cookie locations.
Numbers are generated based on Pat's estimate of the minimum and maximum number of customers per hour at each location, and the average number of cookies they will purchase.
The sales page takes a random number between the min and max, and multiplys it by the average cookie purchase.
